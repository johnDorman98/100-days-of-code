Story: The Enchanted Dungeon

You stand before the entrance of an ancient and treacherous dungeon rumored to hold immeasurable riches. The dungeon is shrouded in darkness, and eerie whispers echo through the corridors. Your goal is to navigate through the dungeon, overcome challenges, and claim the fabled treasure hidden within.

At the beginning of your adventure, you have the following attributes:

- Health: 100
- Level: 1
- Experience Points: 0
- Strength: 5
- Intelligence: 5
- Agility: 5

As you progress through the dungeon and overcome challenges, you will earn experience points (XP) and have opportunities to level up, increasing your attributes and becoming stronger.

Option 1: The Left Corridor
You step into the left corridor, its stone walls covered in moss and dampness. A rickety wooden door lies ahead. What do you do?

1. Push open the door.
2. Examine the door for traps.

If you choose to push open the door:

- The door creaks open, revealing a small chamber with a chest sitting in the center. You approach the chest and prepare to open it.

    - If the chest is opened without caution:
      - A cloud of poisonous gas escapes, engulfing you. You take damage to your health and lose valuable time.

    - If the chest is carefully examined and unlocked:
      - Inside the chest, you find a valuable gemstone and a key to a hidden room, hinting at more treasures within the dungeon.

If you choose to examine the door for traps:

- You carefully inspect the door and find a hidden tripwire. By disabling the trap, you gain access to the chamber beyond.

    - Inside the chamber, you encounter a guardian creature. How do you proceed?

        1. Engage in combat.
        2. Search for a peaceful resolution.
        3. Attempt to outmaneuver the guardian creature using your agility.

        - If you choose to engage in combat:
          - You engage in a fierce battle with the guardian creature. Your health and the creature's health are tracked, and each attack deducts health from the respective opponent. Your strength attribute plays a significant role in dealing damage.

        - If you choose to search for a peaceful resolution:
          - Through clever negotiation, you manage to convince the guardian creature to provide guidance on the safest path to the treasure.

        - If you choose to attempt to outmaneuver the guardian creature using your agility:
          - Your agility attribute comes into play as you use your quick reflexes and nimbleness to dodge the attacks of the guardian creature. Your success depends on your agility level.

Option 2: The Right Corridor
You proceed down the right corridor, feeling the chill of the air intensify with each step. Ahead, there is a fork in the path. Which direction do you choose?

1. Take the path leading upward.
2. Descend deeper into the darkness.

If you choose to take the path leading upward:

- You ascend a narrow staircase that opens into a spacious room. Moonlight filters through a cracked ceiling, illuminating a pedestal upon which the treasure rests.

    - However, the treasure is protected by a magical barrier. How do you proceed?

        1. Search for a hidden switch to deactivate the barrier.
        2. Find a magical artifact to nullify the barrier.

        - Depending on your choice, you may need to face a guardian or solve a puzzle to acquire the switch or the magical artifact. Combat and your health attribute will be crucial in encounters.



If you choose to descend deeper into the darkness:

- You venture into the depths of the dungeon, passing through winding tunnels and encountering menacing creatures. Your agility attribute will be essential in evading traps and ambushes. Additionally, your strength and intelligence attributes will come into play during combat and puzzle-solving.
